/*  
    ---------------------------------
    
    ADS model, bits per channel and other configurations goes to ads129xDriverConfig.h file.
    This file is only for code.

    Constants present in the Datasheet and some helper constant to configure the registers in ADS chip are defined in ads129xDatashhetConstants.h
    Read the documentation in these file to know more about it.
    
    --------------------------------

    Arduino library for ADS1294, ADS1294R, ADS1296, ADS1296R, ADS1298 and ADS1298R chips.
    All these chips share the same datasheet "ADS129x Low-Power, 8-Channel, 24-Bit Analog Front-End for Biopotential Measurements"
    
    Typical usage (see adsDriverExample for an example):
      0- Configure the ADS to use, verbose level and bits per channel (is not the same than resolution) in ads129xDriverConfig
      1- Cal1 the constructor
      2- Call begin method
      3- (Optional) Configure ADS with read/write register methods and related helper methods ({enable/disable}Channel, ...)
      4- Put in Start mode the ADS by sendSPICommandSTART or enableHardwareStartMode methods
      5- Put ADS in RDATA(read one new sample) or RDATAC (read continuously new sample) mode 
      6- Check if new data is available with hasNewDataAvailable method
      7- If so, recover the new data sent by ADS with getData method



    The data format returned by getData is an union named ads_data_t with the same size that the data sent by ADS:
    
      typedef union {
        byte rawData[_ADS_DATA_PACKAGE_SIZE]; // Max possible size (ADS1298 in 24 bit per channel) is : 24 status bits + 24 bits per channel Ã— 4 channels = 216 -> 27 bytes.
        struct {
          byte statusWord[3];
          ads_bits_sample_t channel[ADS_N_CHANNELS]; // ADS_N_CHANNELS is constant generated from ADS chip specified
        } formatedData;
      } ads_data_t;

      ads_bits_sample_t is also an enum that depends with the value of ADS_BITS_PER_CHANNEL constant selected by user (it is defined in ads129xDriverConfig.h)

      If ADS_BITS_PER_CHANNEL is 16, then:
      
          typedef struct ads_bits_sample_t {
            uint8_t hi, low; // High and low byte. It's equivalent to an int of 16 bits.
          } ads_bits_sample_t;
          
      Otherwise: 
      
          typedef struct ads_bits_sample_t {
            uint8_t hi, mid, low; // High, middle and low byte. It's equivalent to an int of 24 bits 
          } ads_bits_sample_t;

          

    The main limitation of this library is that doesn't implement any buffer for data sent by ADS chip. So, if you don't call 
    getData and copy the data to another memory location, the next data retrieval from ADS will overwrite he old. See Limitations 
    section to know about the other few limitations that has the library.

    
    To know which is the minimum SPI speed you need, see page 59, section 9.5.1.2 Serial Clock (SCLK), in the datasheet:
        Minimum SPI speed (in MHz) = 1/((T_sampling - 8 * t_clk)/(Nbits * Nchannels + 24))/1e6 

        T_sampling: signal sample frequency 
        T_clk: ADS clock (typically 2.048 MHz)
        Nbits: number the bits per channels sent by ADS (is the same that ADS_BITS_PER_CHANNEL constant)
        Nchannels: number of channels that has the ADS chip

    Be careful that this formula suppose that their is no delay in the SPI master to operate SPI. It isn't the case for Arduino boards
     
    For the development of this library, the revision K (August 2015) of the datasheet was used.
    
    Limitations:
      1- It hasn't a buffer to save the need data sent by ADS. New data will always overwrite the old data.
      2- Doesn't support send multibyte commands using burst method (see page 63, section 9.5.2.9 Sending Multibyte Commands,
         in the datasheet). See note below.
      3- Doesn't support multiread and multiwrite registers but their implementation is quite trivial. I you would want to
         support them, you need to modify readRegister() and writeRegister() methods.
      4- The maximum SPI speed is 4 MHz instead the theoretical 15/20 MHz due to the lack of the support for multibyte commands using 
         burst method. See note below. This speed might not be enough for ADS1298 or ADS1298R with high sampling rates. You can use 
         the formula gave above to compute the minimum SPI speed you need.
      5- Doesn't support multiple device configuration due to (I believe that there are this only two limitations):
           1- Method that reads the data converted from ADS doesn't support when 2 o more ADS are in Daisy-Chain configuration.
           2- The workaround for interruptions limit to one the active ADS that can be controlled. So, Cascade configuration is not supported.

           See pages 56 and 57, section 9.4.2 Multiple-Device Configuration, in datsheet for more infromation about Mutiple-device Configuration

      Note: implementing burst method and therefore increasing the maximum SPI speed has little sense when Arduino libraries are used. Burst method requiere a high
            time resolution (optimally 0.1 microseconds) that standard Arduino library doesn't provide. However, SPI max speed for data reading in continuous mode could be increased
            if different SPISettings are used to send commands and to read the data sent in the continuous mode (in this mode, no commands are sent to retrieve data from ADS chip).
            However, firstly Arduino boards need to support high SPI transfers. For example, the chip in Arduino zero boards (they use a SAMD21 chip (an ARM M0 microprocessor) allows
            to 24 MHz but it is not recommend to use more than 12 MHz if the peripheral is connected with wires.

            To sum up, increase theoretical maximum SPI speed doesn't seem apport much.
